                <p class="caption margin">This is a free application developed for personal project but is free to download and use.</p>
                <p class="caption margin10">This Privacy Policy informs visitors of the policies relating to the use and disclosure of your personal information.</p>

            <h3 class="uu">Information You Provide to Us</h3>
            <h4 class="bb margin">Account Information</h4>
            <p class="margin4">ILights uses “Firebase Auth” for authentication and you have two ways to sign up: </p>
            <h5 class="margin8">1. Sign in with Google</h5>
            <p class="margin4">When you use this method, we register your email address and the name associated with the Google account used for authentication.</br>This information will be saved into "Firebase Realtime Database System".</p>
            <h5 class="margin8">2. Sign Up</h5>
            <p class="margin4">When using this method, you will need to provide an e-mail/username, a name and select a password to create an account. You are free to choose any username/email which may or maynot exist. However if you choose an username instead of email, then you will not be able to verify your account or use the forget password feature as these feature require email address and Firebase will send links to the email's inbox for these services. We don't store your password anywhere on the database as the auth flow is completely managed by "Firebase Auth System". </p>
            <h4 class="margin10">Role Based Access</h4>
            <ul class="margin4">
                <p class="margin4">There are three levels of users within the app:</p>
                <li>USER [Level: 1]</li>
                <li>ADMIN [Level: 2]</li>
                <li>ADMIN [Level: 3]</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="margin4">After signing up you will have a default <b>Level 1 Access</b>. You can interact with the app instantly.</br>The Users with higher access levels can change your access level without any prior notice if any suspicious activity is detected. Also, the users with admin level access and higher can see your email/username and name which you provided during the signup.</p>
            <p>You have full control over the information you give, at any moment you decide to delete your account which can be done from the settings page. This action will erase all data from the "Firebase Realtime Database" and delete your credentials from the "Firebase Auth" which was collected during the sign up/sign in process.</p>
            <h4 class="margin10">Actions you take</h4>
            <p>The collected information about the actions you take when using ILights. This includes your interactions with controller page, specifically when you change state of any switch, then your name (which you provided during signin/signup) will be shared among all app users to notify the change.</p>
